If not pulling test_defs from a git repo (--test_def_dir), then Zathras will
look here for the various configuration information.

Files:
example.yml: test template file for auto_hpl
entry_order: the order the entries will be in when the template and test_defs.yml
  are merged.
inventory: Ansible inventory file
java_pkg_def.yml:  Defined java versions, and the associated package
setup.conf is used for overriding various values.  Currently supported are
  AWS_USER: which designates the AWS user to use
  AWS_SEC_GRP: which designates the AWS security group.

  Note none of the values provided are verified before they are used.

  Format

  AWS_USER: user1
  AWS_SEC_GRP: user1_secgrp

spot_price.cfg: Spot pricing for clouds
test_defs.yml: The test definitions file.  When Zathras is executed the test_defs.yml
  and template files are merged in to a single file, full_test_defs.yml.
